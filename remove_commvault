- Select problems installing software and look for an entry called windows filesystem agent and windows filesystem agent core.

If not present then delete the 3 CommVault services

If the CommVault software agent(s) fails to un-install from “Add/Remove Programs” or “Programs and Features” you can manually remove
the agent(s) by deleting the following registry keys.

As a preventative measure I recommend exporting the following registry keys before removal.
1.        HKLM_Software\CommVault Systems
2.        HKLM_System\CurrentControlSet\services\    (Find all the GX services and remove them, i.e. GxCVD and GxEvMgrC)
3.        HKLM_Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\    (Find all CommVault hash keys and remove them)
4.        HKEY_Classes_Root\Installer\Products\     (Find all CommVault hash keys and remove them)
5.        Also be sure to check in \Program Files\ and manually delete or rename the Commvault directory
6.        Start - Run and type in %allusersprofile% and manually delete or rename the CommVault directory

Once all above steps are done go to services.msc and see if you still see stale commvault services not cleaned up.

7. Run sc delete <servicename> from admin cmd prompt if step 2 doesn’t clean it up properly or doesn’t display any GX services in registry correctly.
(Not needed if all above cleanups done properly)

8.        Once done retry the install.
